# MEMS-Based Bio-Sensor Simulation for Dengue Fever Detection

This Python simulation models a MEMS cantilever biosensor for early detection of dengue virus using simplified physics.

## Key Features
- Simulates virus binding forces on a silicon cantilever
- Calculates deflection based on mechanical properties
- Identifies threshold-based detections
- Visualizes results with matplotlib

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
python biosensor_simulation.py
